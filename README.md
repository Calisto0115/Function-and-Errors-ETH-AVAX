# Solidity Functions and Errors

Overview 

This is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to withdraw, deposit, and check their balance. It demonstrates the use of  require(), revert(), and assert() statements for error handling and validation.

## Requirements
To interact with the smart contract, you'll need:
* A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts
* An Ethereum wallet or client (e.g., MetaMask) to compile,deploy and interact with the smart contract.
